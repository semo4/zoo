                    From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches
                    their
                    needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it offers. Zoo.Me
                    also
includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to
                    help keep pets in their homes.
