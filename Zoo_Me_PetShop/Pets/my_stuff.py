# You can achieve this by using Django's related_objects feature. This feature allows you to retrieve a related model from another model.

# First, make sure you have a related_name in your foreign key. This allows you to easily retrieve the related model.

# In your case, assuming your foreign key is from the Apply_adoption model to the Pet model, your foreign key should look something like this:

# python
# Copy code
# class Apply_adoption(models.Model):
#     # other fields...
#     pet = models.ForeignKey(Pet, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='adoptions')
# Once you have that, you can join the filtered object with another model by following these steps:

# Get the Apply_adoption object that you want to retrieve the related Pet object for.
# Use the related_name (in this case, 'adoptions') to get the related Pet object.
# Here's how you can implement this in your views.py:

# python
# Copy code
# def get_pet_information(apply_adoption):
#     # This will give you the related Pet object
#     pet = apply_adoption.pet
#     # You can then get the pet information
#     pet_information = {
#         'name': pet.name,
#         'breed': pet.breed,
#         'age': pet.age,
#         # ... any other fields you need
#     }
#     return pet_information

# apply_adoptions = Apply_adoption.objects.filter(user_owner_id=user_id)
# apply_adoptions_with_pet_info = []

# for apply_adoption in apply_adoptions:
#     pet_info = get_pet_information(apply_adoption)
#     apply_adoption_with_pet_info = apply_adoption.__dict__
#     apply_adoption_with_pet_info.update(pet_info)
#     apply_adoptions_with_pet_info.append(apply_adoption_with_pet_info)
# In this example, we created a function called get_pet_information that takes an Apply_adoption object as a parameter and returns a dictionary containing the pet information.

# Then, we looped through each Apply_adoption object in the apply_adoptions queryset, got the pet information using the get_pet_information function, and updated the apply_adoption object's dictionary with the pet information. Finally, we appended the updated dictionary to the apply_adoptions_with_pet_info list.

# The result is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the information of an Apply_adoption object and the related Pet object.
